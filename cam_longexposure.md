When capturing long exposure photographs of a starry sky, the exposure time can vary significantly depending on the effect you want to achieve. Here are some guidelines for different scenarios:
1. Star Points (Stars as Dots):

If you want the stars to appear as sharp points of light without noticeable trails, you need to use relatively short exposure times. The rule of thumb is the 500 Rule:

Exposure Time (seconds)=500Focal Length (mm)Exposure Time (seconds)=Focal Length (mm)500​

    Full Frame Camera: Use the focal length directly.
    Crop Sensor Camera: Divide the focal length by the crop factor (e.g., 1.5x for APS-C, 2x for Micro Four Thirds) before using the formula.

Example:

    For a 24mm lens on a full-frame camera: 50024≈2124500​≈21 seconds.
    For a 24mm lens on an APS-C camera with a 1.5x crop factor: 500(24×1.5)≈14(24×1.5)500​≈14 seconds.

2. Star Trails:

If you want to capture the motion of the stars across the sky, longer exposures are needed. The length of the trails will depend on how long the exposure is:

    Short Trails: 5 to 15 minutes
    Medium Trails: 15 to 30 minutes
    Long Trails: 30 minutes to several hours

Practical Considerations:

    Stacking: For very long exposures (especially over 30 minutes), it's often better to take multiple shorter exposures and stack them in post-processing to reduce noise and manage camera sensor heating. Software like DeepSkyStacker or StarStaX can be used for this.
    Aperture and ISO: Use a wide aperture (e.g., f/2.8, f/4) and a moderate ISO (e.g., ISO 800 to ISO 3200). Adjust these settings based on your camera’s noise performance and the ambient light conditions.
    Stable Tripod: Ensure you have a very stable tripod to avoid any camera movement during the long exposure.
    Remote Shutter Release: Use a remote shutter release or the camera's timer function to prevent camera shake when starting the exposure.
    Dark Frame: Take a dark frame (a shot with the lens cap on, same settings) to help reduce sensor noise during post-processing.

Example Long Exposure Setup for Star Trails:

    Camera Settings:
        Mode: Manual or Bulb
        Aperture: f/2.8 to f/4
        ISO: 800 to 3200
        Exposure: 5 minutes (for multiple shorter exposures)

    Take Multiple Exposures:
        Capture multiple 5-minute exposures to stack later. This helps in reducing noise and allows for easier post-processing.
        Example: To achieve a total exposure time of 1 hour, you would take 12 x 5-minute exposures.

    Post-Processing:
        Stack the multiple exposures using software like DeepSkyStacker to create a single image with star trails.
        Combine the dark frame to reduce noise.

Summary:

    Star Points: Use the 500 Rule to calculate the maximum exposure time.
    Star Trails: Use longer exposures (5 minutes to several hours) and consider stacking multiple shorter exposures.
    Equipment: Wide aperture lens, stable tripod, remote shutter release, and post-processing software for stacking.

By experimenting with these settings and techniques, you can capture beautiful long exposure photos of the starry sky.
